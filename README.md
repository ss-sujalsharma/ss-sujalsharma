Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sujal Sharma, a full-stack developer and Salesforce CRM enthusiast with experience in building scalable web applications and AI-integrated automation systems. Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects across frontend, backend, and CRM platformsâ€”primarily using JavaScript, Python, Apex, and the Salesforce ecosystem.

Presently, I am actively working on **SmartMeet AI**, an enterprise-grade video conferencing platform enhanced with real-time transcription, translation, and intelligent meeting analytics using OpenAI and WebRTC. The platform supports 500+ concurrent users with <150ms latency and offers powerful post-meeting AI-generated summaries and decision tracking. This 6-month project showcases my ability to combine backend scalability, frontend usability, and AI intelligence into one product.

In my previous internship as a **Salesforce Developer**, I designed automation workflows, integrated REST/SOAP APIs, and maintained 95%+ code coverage using Apex test classes. Iâ€™ve also independently built conversational tools with Gemini and NLP APIs, exploring AI reasoning, code evaluation, and feedback loop generation.

Outside of technical development, I enjoy learning in public, contributing to open-source-style case studies, and mentoring fellow developers who are new to Salesforce or AI. I am particularly passionate about using technology to improve real-world CRM and collaboration experiences for users, businesses, and communities.

I love building with Salesforce, writing clean Python code, and experimenting with LLMs like OpenAI and Gemini. Feel free to drop me a message at sujalsharma44921@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ss-sujalsharma) if you'd like to collaborate or discuss Salesforce, Python, or AI-powered systems.

Letâ€™s build something impactful together ðŸš€
